### Added

- Document alternatives to jbanking (#164).
- Make `CreditorIdentifier#REGEX` public (as part of #172).

### Changed

- (**breaking change**) Make `CreditorIdentifier` final (#116).
- (**breaking change**) Rename `Bic#BIC_REGEX` to `Bic#REGEX` and change it to not accept lower-case characters anymore
  (as part of #170).
- Get rid of regexes to validate BICs (#170). This significantly increased the performances of BIC validation (+200%)
  and creation (+300%).
- Get rid of regexes to validate Creditor Identifiers (#172). This significantly increased the performances of
  Creditor Identifiers validation (+30-40%) and creation (+30-50%).
- Improve javadoc (as part of #170 and #172).
- Add the _state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II_ day to London calendar (#204).
- Add the _national day of mourning for Her Majesty The Queen_ day to Sydney calendar (#204).

### Fixed

- (**breaking change**) `Iban.isValid(String)` or `IbanCheckDigit.validate(String)` return `false` instead of raising an
  `IllegalArgumentException` with invalid IBAN check digit (e.g. `00`, `01`, or `99`).

### Deprecated

### Removed

- (**breaking change**) Remove `Bic#BIC_PATTERN` (as part of #170). If you still need to use the BIC regex, you may compile
  the pattern from `Bic#REGEX`, which has been kept for compatibility and documentation purposes.
